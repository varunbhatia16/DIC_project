This folder contains simple frontends and backends to use in testing Sparrow's performance.

For users new to Sparrow, the SimpleFrontend and SimpleBackend classes provide a good minimal example of what a Sparrow application looks like. The SimpleFrontend launches jobs with a fixed number of tasks at a fixed period; the SimpleBackend runs the tasks, which simply sleep for a specified period of time.
