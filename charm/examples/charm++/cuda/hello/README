Hello World in Charm with CUDA using the hybrid API.

This example passes a Hi message along the array from index 0 to N. Each chare 
executes an empty kernel on the GPU when it receives the message. 
When the kernel returns, the runtime system executes the specified callback 
function which passes the message to the subsequent chare in the array.
