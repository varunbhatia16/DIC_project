chunks and main in same file gives weird emitter bug
.decl.h include should come after other includes, not before
    also after 'using' statements (for CharjArray::Array)
multiple pointer types declared together are wrong
    ie X x, y => X* x, y;, which is wrong
we're dereferencing chare array ids as though they were local pointers
only the first array access in an expression rhs gets translated correctly
    eg, B[i] = 0.5 * (A[i] + A[j]) leaves A[j] untranslated to an access call
    same problem for function arguments
local pointers to arguments in entry methods omit template types
sdag translator doesn't like extra set of braces around sdag func bodies
    ie entry void x() {{ body text }}
