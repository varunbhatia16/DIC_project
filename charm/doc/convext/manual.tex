\chapter{Introduction}

The \converse{} Extensions Library is a collection of modules that have
been implemented on top of the \converse{} API.  Each of these modules was
deemed potentially useful to other \converse{} users, thus, we distribute
these modules along with \converse{} as a convenience.  {\em You don't
need to read any part of this manual to use \converse{}.}
