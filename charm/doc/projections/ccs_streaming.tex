Projections provides a continuous performance monitoring tool - CCS streaming. 
Different from other tools discussed above, which are used to visualize post-mortem data, 
ccs streaming visualizes the running programs. In order to use it, the Charm++
program needs to be linked with \textbf{-tracemode utilization}.
The command line needs to include "++server ++server-port 2345". "2345" is 
the socket port number on server side.
In projections ccs streaming tool, the port number should be same with that on server side.
