To facilitate debugging of applications and to identify race conditions due to
message order, the user can enable randomized scheduler queue. 

Using the build command \verb|--enable-randomized-msgqq|, the charm message queue
will be randomized. Note that a randomized message queue is only available when
message priority type is not bit vector.  Therefore, the user needs to specify
prio-type to be a data type long enough to hold the msg priorities in your
application for eg: \verb|--with-prio-type = int|.
