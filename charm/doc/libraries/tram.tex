\section{Overview}

Topological Routing and Aggregation Module is a library for optimization of
many-to-many and all-to-all collective communication patterns in Charm++
applications. The library performs topological routing and aggregation of
network communication in the context of a virtual grid topology comprising the
Charm++ Processing Elements (PEs) in the parallel run. The number of dimensions
and their sizes within this topology are specified by the user when initializing
an instance of the library.

TRAM is implemented as a Charm++ group, so an \emph{instance}
of TRAM has one object on every PE used in the run. We use
the term \emph{local instance} to denote a member of the TRAM
group on a particular PE.

Most collective communication patterns involve sending linear arrays
of a single data type. In order to more efficiently aggregate and
process data, TRAM restricts the data sent using the
library to a single data type specified by the user through a template
parameter when initializing an instance of the library. We use the
term \emph{data item} to denote a single object of this datatype
submitted to the library for sending. While the library is active
(i.e. after initialization and before termination), an arbitrary
number of data items can be submitted to the library at each PE.

On systems with an underlying grid or torus network topology, it can be
beneficial to configure the virtual topology for TRAM to match the physical
topology of the network. This can easily be accomplished using the Charm++
Topology Manager.

The next two sections explain the routing and aggregation techniques
used in the library.

\subsection{Routing}

Let the variables $j$ and $k$ denote PEs within an N-dimensional
virtual topology of PEs and $x$ denote a dimension of the grid. We
represent the coordinates of $j$ and $k$ within the grid as $\left
(j_0, j_1, \ldots, j_{N-1} \right) $ and $ \left (k_0, k_1, \ldots,
k_{N-1} \right) $.  Also, let
\[
f(x, j, k) =
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } j_x = k_x \\
1, & \text{if } j_x \ne k_x
\end{cases}
\]

$j$ and $k$ are \emph{peers} if
\[
\sum_{d=0}^{N-1} f(d, j, k) = 1 .
\]
When using TRAM, PEs communicate directly only with their
peers. Sending to a PE which is not a peer is handled inside the
library by routing the data through one or more \emph{intermediate
  destinations} along the route to the \emph{final destination}.

Suppose a data item destined for PE $k$ is submitted to the library at
PE $j$. If $k$ is a peer of $j$, the data item will be sent directly
to $k$, possibly along with other data items for which $k$ is the
final or intermediate destination.  If $k$ is not a peer of $j$, the
data item will be sent to an intermediate destination $m$ along the
route to $k$ whose index is $\left (j_0, j_1, \ldots, j_{i-1}, k_i,
j_{i+1}, \ldots, j_{N-1} \right)$, where $i$ is the greatest value of
$x$ for which $f(x, j, k) = 1$.

Note that in obtaining the coordinates of $m$ from $j$, exactly one of
the coordinates of $j$ which differs from the coordinates of $k$ is
made to agree with $k$. It follows that m is a peer of $j$, and that
using this routing process at $m$ and every subsequent intermediate
destination along the route eventually leads to the data item being
received at $k$. Consequently, the number of messages $F(j, k)$ that
will carry the data item to the destination is
\[
F(j,k) = \sum_{d=0}^{N-1}f(d, j, k) .
\]

\subsection{Aggregation}

Communicating over the network of a parallel machine involves per
message bandwidth and processing overhead. TRAM amortizes
this overhead by aggregating data items at the source and every
intermediate destination along the route to the final destination.

Every local instance of the TRAM group buffers the data items that have been
submitted locally or received from another PE for forwarding. Because only peers
communicate directly in the virtual grid, it suffices to have a single buffer
per PE for every peer. Given a dimension d within the virtual topology, let
$s_d$ denote its \emph{size}, or the number of distinct values a coordinate for
dimension d can take. Consequently, each local instance allocates up to $s_d - 1
$ buffers per dimension, for a total of $\sum_{d=0}^{N-1} (s_d - 1) $
buffers. Note that this is normally significantly less than the total number of
PEs specified by the virtual topology, which is equal to $\prod_{d=0}^{N-1}
{s_d}$.

Sending with TRAM is done by submitting a data item and a
destination identifier, either PE or array index, using a function
call to the local instance.  If the index belongs to a peer, the
library places the data item in the buffer for the peer's
PE. Otherwise, the library calculates the index of the intermediate
destination using the previously described algorithm, and places the
data item in the buffer for the resulting PE, which by design is
always a peer of the local PE. Buffers are sent out immediately
when they become full. When a message is received at an intermediate
destination, the data items comprising it are distributed into the
appropriate buffers for subsequent sending. In the process, if a data
item is determined to have reached its final destination, it is
immediately delivered.

The total buffering capacity specified by the user may be reached even
when no single buffer is completely filled up. In that case the buffer
with the greatest number of buffered data items is sent.

\section{Application User Interface}

A typical usage scenario for TRAM involves a start-up phase followed by one or
more \emph{communication steps}. We next describe the application user interface
and details relevant to usage of the library, which normally follows these
steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Start-up}} Creation of a TRAM group and set up of client
  arrays and groups
\item{\textbf{Initialization}} Calling an initialization function,
  which returns through a callback
\item{\textbf{Sending}} An arbitrary number of sends using the
  \code{insertData} function call on the local instance of the library
\item{\textbf{Receiving}} Processing received data items through the
  \code{process} function which serves as the delivery
  interface for the library and must be defined by the user
\item{\textbf{Termination}} Termination of a communication step
\item{\textbf{Re-initialization}} After termination of a communication step, the
  library instance is not active. However, re-initialization using step $2$
  leads to a new communication step.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Start-Up}

Start-up is typically performed once in a program, often inside the \code{main}
function of the mainchare, and involves creating an aggregator instance. An
instance of TRAM is restricted to sending data items of a single user-specified
type, which we denote by \code{dtype}, to a single user-specified chare array or
group.

\subsubsection{Sending to a Group}
To use TRAM for sending to a group, a \code{GroupMeshStreamer} group should be
created. Either of the following two \code{GroupMeshStreamer} constructors can
be used for that purpose:

\begin{alltt}
template<class dtype, class ClientType, class RouterType>
GroupMeshStreamer<dtype, ClientType, RouterType>::
GroupMeshStreamer(int maxNumDataItemsBuffered,
                  int numDimensions,
                  int *dimensionSizes,
                  CkGroupID clientGID,
                  bool yieldFlag = 0,
                  double progressPeriodInMs = -1.0);

template<class dtype, class ClientType, class RouterType>
GroupMeshStreamer<dtype, ClientType, RouterType>::
GroupMeshStreamer(int numDimensions,
                  int *dimensionSizes,
                  CkGroupID clientGID,
                  int bufferSize,
                  bool yieldFlag = 0,
                  double progressPeriodInMs = -1.0);

\end{alltt}

\subsubsection{Sending to a Chare Array}
For sending to a chare array, an \code{ArrayMeshStreamer} group should be
created, which has a similar constructor interface to \code{GroupMeshStreamer}:

\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype, class itype, class ClientType,
          class RouterType>
ArrayMeshStreamer<dtype, itype, ClientType, RouterType>::
ArrayMeshStreamer(int maxNumDataItemsBuffered,
                  int numDimensions,
                  int *dimensionSizes,
                  CkArrayID clientAID,
                  bool yieldFlag = 0,
                  double progressPeriodInMs = -1.0);

template <class dtype, class itype, class ClientType,
          class RouterType>
ArrayMeshStreamer<dtype, itype, ClientType, RouterType>::
ArrayMeshStreamer(int numDimensions,
                  int *dimensionSizes,
                  CkArrayID clientAID,
                  int bufferSize,
                  bool yieldFlag = 0,
                  double progressPeriodInMs = -1.0);

\end{alltt}

Description of parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{maxNumDataItemsBuffered}: maximum number of items that the
  library is allowed to buffer per PE
\item \code{numDimensions}: number of dimensions in grid of PEs
\item \code{dimensionSizes}: array of size \code{numDimensions} containing the
  size of each dimension in the grid
\item \code{clientGID}: the group ID for the client group
\item \code{clientAID}: the array ID for the client array
\item \code{bufferSize}: size of the buffer for each peer,
  in terms of number of data items
\item \code{yieldFlag}: when true, calls \code{CthYield()} after every $1024$
  item insertions; setting it true requires all data items to be submitted from
  threaded entry methods. Ensures that pending messages are sent out by the
  runtime system when a large number of data items are submitted from a single
  entry method.
\item \code{progressPeriodInMs}: number of milliseconds between periodic
  progress checks; relevant only when periodic flushing is enabled (see
  Section~\ref{sec:tram_termination})
\end{itemize}

Template parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{dtype}: data item type
\item \code{itype}: index type of client chare array (use \code{int} for
  one-dimensional chare arrays and \code{CkArrayIndex} for all other index
  types)
\item \code{ClientType}: type of client group or array
\item \code{RouterType}: the routing protocol to be used. The choices are: \\
  (1) \code{SimpleMeshRouter} - original grid aggregation scheme; \\
  (2) \code{NodeAwareMeshRouter} - base node-aware aggregation scheme; \\
  (3) \code{AggressiveNodeAwareMeshRouter} - advanced node-aware aggregation scheme;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initialization}

A TRAM instance needs to be initialized before every communication step. There
are currently three main modes of operation, depending on the type of
termination used: \emph{staged completion}, \emph{completion detection}, or
\emph{quiescence detection}. The modes of termination are described later. Here,
we present the interface for initializing a communication step for each of the
three modes.

When using completion detection, each local instance of TRAM must be initialized
using the following variant of the overloaded \code{init} function:

\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype, class RouterType>
void MeshStreamer<dtype, RouterType>::
init(int numContributors,
     CkCallback startCb,
     CkCallback endCb,
     CProxy_CompletionDetector detector,
     int prio,
     bool usePeriodicFlushing);
\end{alltt}

Description of parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{numContributors}: number of \code{done} calls expected globally
  before termination of this communication step
\item \code{startCb}: callback to be invoked by the library after
  initialization is complete
\item \code{endCb}: callback to be invoked by the library after termination
  of this communication step
\item \code{detector}: an inactive \code{CompletionDetector} object to be used by TRAM
\item \code{prio}: Charm++ priority to be used for messages sent using TRAM in
  this communication step
\item \code{usePeriodicFlushing}: specifies whether periodic flushing should
  be used for this communication step
\end{itemize}

When using staged completion, a completion detector object is not required as
input, as the library performs its own specialized form of termination. In this
case, each local instance of TRAM must be initialized using a different
interface for the overloaded \code{init} function:

\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype, class RouterType>
void MeshStreamer<dtype, RouterType>::
init(int numLocalContributors,
     CkCallback startCb,
     CkCallback endCb,
     int prio,
     bool usePeriodicFlushing);

\end{alltt}

Note that \code{numLocalContributors} denotes the local number of \code{done}
calls expected, rather than the global as in the first interface of \code{init}.

A common case is to have a single chare array perform all the sends in a
communication step, with each element of the array as a contributor. For this
case there is a special version of \code{init} that takes as input the
\code{CkArrayID} object for the chare array that will perform the sends,
precluding the need to manually determine the number of client chares per PE:

\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype, class RouterType>
void MeshStreamer<dtype, RouterType>::
init(CkArrayID senderArrayID,
     CkCallback startCb,
     CkCallback endCb,
     int prio,
     bool usePeriodicFlushing);
\end{alltt}

The \code{init} interface for using quiescence detection is:

\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype, class RouterType>
void MeshStreamer<dtype, RouterType>::init(CkCallback startCb,
                                           int prio);
\end{alltt}

After initialization is finished, the system invokes \code{startCb},
signalling to the user that the library is ready to accept data items
for sending.
\\

%\textbf{proposed addition: add a non-streaming all-to-all interface,
%  which should not require an init call}

\subsection{Sending}

Sending with TRAM is done through calls to \code{insertData} and
\code{broadcast}.

\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype, class RouterType>
void MeshStreamer<dtype, RouterType>::
insertData(const dtype& dataItem,
           int destinationPe);

template <class dtype, class itype, class ClientType,
          class RouterType>
void ArrayMeshStreamer<dtype, itype, ClientType, RouterType>::
insertData(const dtype& dataItem,
           itype arrayIndex);

template <class dtype, class RouterType>
void MeshStreamer<dtype, RouterType>::
broadcast(const dtype& dataItem);
\end{alltt}

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{dataItem}: reference to a data item to be sent
\item \code{destinationPe}: index of destination PE
\item \code{arrayIndex}: index of destination array element
\end{itemize}

Broadcasting has the effect of delivering the data item:
\begin{itemize}
\item {once on every PE involved in the computation for \code{GroupMeshStreamer}}
\item {once for every array element involved in the computation for
       \code{ArrayMeshStreamer}}
\end{itemize}

%\textbf{proposed addition: add an interface for sending an array of
%  data items}

\subsection{Receiving}

To receive data items sent using TRAM, the user must define
the \code{process} function for each client group and array:

\begin{alltt}
void process(const dtype  &ran);
\end{alltt}

Each item is delivered by the library using a separate call to \code{process} on
the destination PE. The call is made locally, so process should not be an entry
method.

\subsection{Termination}
\label{sec:tram_termination}

Flushing and termination mechanisms are used in TRAM to prevent deadlock due to
indefinite buffering of items. Flushing works by sending out all buffers in a
local instance if no items have been submitted or received since the last
progress check. Meanwhile, termination detection is used to send out partially
filled buffers at the end of a communication step after it has been determined
that no additional items will be submitted.

Currently, three means of termination are supported: staged completion,
completion detection, and quiescence detection. Periodic flushing is a secondary
mechanism which can be enabled or disabled when initiating one of the primary
mechanisms.

Termination typically requires the user to issue a number of calls to the
\code{done} function:
\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype, class RouterType>
void MeshStreamer<dtype, RouterType>::
done(int numContributorsFinished = 1);
\end{alltt}
When using completion detection, the number of done calls that are expected
globally by the TRAM instance is specified using the \code{numContributors}
parameter to \code{init}. Safe termination requires that no calls to
\code{insertData} or \code{broadcast} are made after the last call to
\code{done} is performed globally. Because order of execution is uncertain in
parallel applications, some care is required to ensure the above condition is
met. A simple way to terminate safely is to set \code{numContributors} equal to
the number of senders, and call done once for each sender that is done
submitting items.

In contrast to using completion detection, using staged completion involves
setting the local number of expected calls to \code{done} using the
\code{numLocalContributors} parameter in the \code{init} function. To ensure
safe termination, no \code{insertData} or \code{broadcast} calls should be made
on any PE where \code{done} has been called the expected number of times.

Another version of \code{init} for staged completion, which takes a
\code{CkArrayID} object as an argument, provides a simplified interface in the
common case when a single chare array performs all the sends within a
communication step, with each of its elements as a contributor. For this version
of \code{init}, TRAM determines the appropriate number of local contributors
automatically. It also correctly handles the case of PEs without any
contributors by immediately marking those PEs as having finished the
communication step. As such, this version of \code{init} should be preferred by
the user when applicable.

Staged completion is not supported when array location data is not guaranteed to
be correct, as this can potentially violate the termination conditions used to
guarantee successful termination. In order to guarantee correct location data in
applications that use load balancing, Charm++ must be compiled with
\code{-DCMK\underline{\hspace{.2cm}}GLOBAL\underline{\hspace{.2cm}}LOCATION\underline{\hspace{.2cm}}UPDATE},
which has the effect of performing a global broadcast of location data for chare
array elements that migrate during load balancing. Unfortunately, this operation
is expensive when migrating large numbers of elements. As an alternative,
completion detection and quiescence detection modes will work properly without
the global location update mechanism, and even in the case of anytime migration.

When using quiescence detection, no end callback is used, and no \code{done}
calls are required. Instead, termination of a communication step is achieved
using the quiescence detection framework in \charm{}, which supports passing a
callback as parameter. TRAM is set up such that quiescence will not be detected
until all items sent in the current communication step have been delivered to
their final destinations.

The choice of which termination mechanism to use is left to the user. Using
completion detection mode is more convenient when the global number of
contributors is known, while staged completion is easier to use if the local
number of contributors can be determined with ease, or if sending is done from
the elements of a chare array. If either mode can be used with ease, staged
completion should be preferred. Unlike the other mechanisms, staged completion
does not involve persistent background communication to determine when the
global number of expected \code{done} calls is reached. Staged completion is
also generally faster at reaching termination due to not being dependent on
periodic progress checks. Unlike completion detection, staged completion does
incur a small bandwidth overhead ($4$ bytes) for every TRAM message, but in
practice this is more than offset by the persistent traffic incurred by
completion detection.

Periodic flushing is an auxiliary mechanism which checks at a regular interval
whether any sends have taken place since the last time the check was
performed. If not, the mechanism sends out all the data items buffered per local
instance of the library. The period is specified by the user in the TRAM
constructor. A typical use case for periodic flushing is when the submission of
a data item B to TRAM happens as a result of the delivery of another data item A
sent using the same TRAM instance. If A is buffered inside the library and
insufficient data items are submitted to cause the buffer holding A to be sent
out, a deadlock could arise. With the periodic flushing mechanism, the buffer
holding A is guaranteed to be sent out eventually, and deadlock is
prevented. Periodic flushing is required when using the completion detection or
quiescence detection termination modes.

\subsection{Re-initialization}

A TRAM instance that has terminated cannot be used for sending more data items
until it has been re-initialized. Re-initialization is achieved by calling
\code{init}, which prepares the instance of the library for a new communication
step. Re-initialization is useful for iterative applications, where it is often
convenient to have a single communication step per iteration of the application.

\subsection{Charm++ Registration of Templated Classes}

Due to the use of templates in TRAM, the library template instances must be
explicitly registered with the Charm++ runtime by the user of the library. This
must be done in the \code{.ci} file for the application, and typically involves
three steps.

For \code{GroupMeshStreamer} template instances, registration is done as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Registration of the message type:}
\begin{alltt}
message MeshStreamerMessage<dtype>;
\end{alltt}
\item{Registration of the base aggregator class}
\begin{alltt}
group MeshStreamer<dtype, RouterType>;
\end{alltt}
\item{Registration of the derived aggregator class}
\begin{alltt}
group GroupMeshStreamer<dtype, ClientType, RouterType>;
\end{alltt}
\end{itemize}

For \code{ArrayMeshStreamer} template instances, registration is done as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Registration of the message type:}
\begin{alltt}
message MeshStreamerMessage<ArrayDataItem<dtype, itype> >;
\end{alltt}
\item{Registration of the base aggregator class}
\begin{alltt}
group MeshStreamer<ArrayDataItem<dtype, itype>,
                   RouterType>;
\end{alltt}
\item{Registration of the derived aggregator class}
\begin{alltt}
group ArrayMeshStreamer<dtype, itype, ClientType,
                        RouterType>;
\end{alltt}
\end{itemize}
