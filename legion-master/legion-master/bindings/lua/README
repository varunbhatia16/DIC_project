* How to compile binding library

To build the binding library, you need the following dependencies to
be installed:

- Legion runtime
- LuaJIT interpreter
- LuaBind library

Each of these dependencies should be specified by LUAJIT_DIR,
LUABIND_DIR, and LG_RT_DIR variable, respectively, in your shell
environment.

For the moment, you can use only the revision of legion runtime at the
time of commit 1dbf21a9629292b5cee760eee98c422b45b4e609 is
applied. The source code of binding library is not compiled with the
recent changes in Legion runtime.

You should use LuaJIT interpreter version 5.1 and install it in the
following configuration:

- LUAJIT_DIR is the top most directory
- All the header files should be in either LUAJIT_DIR/include/ or
  LUAJIT_DIR/include/luajit-2.0
- All the static and shared libraries should be in LUAJIT_DIR/lib and
  the name of the shared library should be libluajit-5.1.so

To build a LuaBind library that is compatible with LuaJIT interpreter,
you need to customize its build script. You can check out the source
code from its github page at https://github.com/luabind/luabind. After
checking out the source code, you patch modify Jamroot file using
Jamroot.diff as follows:

patch -p0 Jamroot < Jamroot.diff

For the build instruction of LuaBind library, please consult with the
LuaBind's github page.

* How to use binding library

In order to use lua binding, you should load legion.lua in your lua
code. As the legion.lua file tries to find libbinding.so file in the
current directory, you need to make sure that the binding library is
in the directory your lua source files locate. Please find out saxpy
example in examples/saxpy directory for the details of how to use
binding library.
