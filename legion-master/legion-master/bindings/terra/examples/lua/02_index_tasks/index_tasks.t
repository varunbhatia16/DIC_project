  -- To aid in describing structured data, Legion supports
  -- a Rect type which is used to describe an array of
  -- points.  To specify a Rect a user gives two Points
  -- which specify the lower and upper bounds on each dimension
  -- respectively.  Here we create a 1-D Rect which
  -- we'll use to launch an array of tasks.  Note that the
  -- bounds on Rects are inclusive.

  -- take Domains.

  -- When we go to launch a large group of tasks in a single
  -- call, we may want to pass different arguments to each
  -- task.  ArgumentMaps allow the user to pass different
  -- arguments to different points.  Note that ArgumentMaps
  -- do not need to specify arguments for all points.  Legion
  -- is intelligent about only passing arguments to the tasks
  -- that have them.  Here we pass some values that we'll
  -- use to illustrate how values get returned from an index
  -- task launch.

  -- a TaskArgument which is a global argument that will
  -- be passed to all tasks launched, and a domain describing
  -- the points to be launched.
