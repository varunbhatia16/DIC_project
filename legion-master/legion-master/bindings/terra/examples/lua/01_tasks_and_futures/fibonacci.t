    -- fields which we will explore throughout the examples.  Here
    -- we look at the first two arguments: the ID of the kind of
    -- task to launch and a 'TaskArgument'.  The ID of the task
    -- must correspond to one of the IDs registered with the Legion
    -- runtime before the application began.  A 'TaskArgument' internally
    -- allocates a buffer of the specified type and stores the value
    -- in the buffer.  It is important to note that this buffer is

    -- be reused to launch as many tasks as desired, and can be modified

    -- is generating the future returns.  Note that waiting on a future
    -- that is not ready blocks this task, but does not block the processor
    -- on which the task is running.  If additional tasks have been mapped
    -- onto this processor and they are ready to execute, then they will
    -- begin running as soon as the call to 'get_result' is made.
