  -- Instead of using an inline mapping to initialize the fields for
  -- daxpy, in this case we will launch two separate tasks for initializing
  -- each of the fields in parallel.  To launch the sub-tasks for performing
  -- the initialization we again use the launcher objects that were
  -- introduced earlier.  The only difference now is that instead of passing
  -- arguments by value, we now want to specify the logical regions
  -- that the tasks may access as their arguments.  We again make use of
  -- the RegionRequirement struct to name the logical regions and fields
  -- for which the task should have privileges.  In this case we launch
  -- a task that asks for WRITE_DISCARD privileges on the 'X' field.
  --
  -- An important property of the Legion programming model is that sub-tasks
  -- are only allowed to request privileges which are a subset of a
  -- parent task's privileges.  When a task creates a logical region it
  -- is granted full read-write privileges for that logical region.  It
  -- can then pass them down to sub-tasks.  In this example the top-level
  -- task has full privileges on all the fields of input_lr and output_lr.
  -- In this call it passing read-write privileges down to the sub-task
  -- on input_lr on field 'X'.  Legion will enforce the property that the
  -- sub-task only accesses the 'X' field of input_lr.  This property of
  -- Legion is crucial for the implementation of Legion's hierarchical
  -- scheduling algorithm which is described in detail in our two papers.

  -- Re-use the same launcher but with a slightly different RegionRequirement
  -- that requests privileges on field 'Y' instead of 'X'.  Since these
  -- two instances of the init_field_task are accessing different fields
  -- of the input_lr region, they can be run in parallel (whether or not
  -- they do is dependent on the mapping discussed in a later example).
  -- Legion automatically will discover this parallelism since the runtime
  -- understands the fields present on the logical region.
  --
  -- We now call attention to a unique property of the init_field_task.
  -- In this example we've actually called the task with two different
  -- region requirements containing different fields.  The init_field_task
  -- is an example of a field-polymorphic task which is capable of
  -- performing the same operation on different fields of a logical region.
  -- In practice this is very useful property for a task to maintain as
  -- it allows one implementation of a task to be written which is capable
  -- of being used in many places.
