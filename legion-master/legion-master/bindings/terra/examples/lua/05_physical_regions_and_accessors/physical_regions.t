  -- Now that we have our logical regions we want to instantiate physical
  -- instances of these regions which we can use for storing data.  One way
  -- of creating a physical instance of a logical region is via an inline
  -- mapping operation.  (We'll discuss the other way of creating physical
  -- instances in the next example.)  Inline mappings map a physical instance
  -- of logical region inside of this task's context.  This will give the
  -- task an up-to-date copy of the data stored in these logical regions.
  -- In this particular daxpy example, the data has yet to be initialized so
  -- really this just creates un-initialized physical regions for the
  -- application to use.
  --
  -- To perform an inline mapping we use an InlineLauncher object which is
  -- similar to other launcher objects shown earlier.  The argument passed
  -- to this launcher is a 'RegionRequirement' which is used to specify which
  -- logical region we should be mapping as well as with what privileges
  -- and coherence.  In this example we are mapping the input_lr logical
  -- region with READ-WRITE privilege and EXCLUSIVE coherence.  We'll see
  -- examples of other privileges in later examples.  If you're interested
  -- in learning about relaxed coherence modes we refer you to our OOPSLA paper.
  -- The last argument in the RegionRequirement is the logical region for
  -- which the enclosing task has privileges which in this case is the
  -- same input_lr logical region.  We'll discuss restrictions on privileges
  -- more in the next example.
  local req = RegionRequirement:new(input_lr, legion.READ_WRITE,
                                    legion.EXCLUSIVE, input_lr)
  -- We also need to specify which fields we plan to access in our
  -- RegionRequirement.  To do this we invoke the 'add_field' method
  -- on the RegionRequirement.
  req:add_field(FID_X)
  req:add_field(FID_Y)
  local input_launcher = InlineLauncher:new(req)

  -- Once we have set up our launcher, we as the runtime to map a physical
  -- region instance of our requested logical region with the given
  -- privileges and coherence.  This returns a PhysicalRegion object
  -- which is handle to the physical instance which contains data
  -- for the logical region.  In keeping with Legion's deferred execution
  -- model the 'map_region' call is asynchronous.  This allows the
  -- application to issue many of these operations in flight and to
  -- perform other useful work while waiting for the region to be ready.
  --
  -- One common criticism about Legion applications is that there exists
  -- a dichotomy between logical and physical regions.  Programmers
  -- are explicitly required to keep track of both kinds of regions and
  -- know when and how to use them.  If you feel this way as well, we
  -- encourage you to try out our Legion compiler in which this
  -- dichotomy does not exist.  There are simply regions and the compiler
  -- automatically manages the logical and physical nature of them
  -- in a way that is analogous to how compilers manage the mapping
  -- between variables and architectural registers.  This runtime API
  -- is designed to be expressive for all Legion programs and is not
  -- necessarily designed for programmer productivity.
  local input_region = runtime:map_region(ctx, input_launcher)
  -- The application can either poll a physical region to see when it
  -- contains valid data for the logical region using the 'is_valid'
  -- method or it can explicitly wait using the 'wait_until_valid'
  -- method.  Just like waiting on a future, if the region is not ready
  -- this task is pre-empted and other tasks may run while waiting
  -- for the region to be ready.  Note that an application does not
  -- need to explicitly wait for the physical region to be ready before
  -- using it, but any call to get an accessor (described next) on
  -- phsyical region that does not yet have valid data will implicitly
  -- call 'wait_until_valid' to guarantee correct execution by ensuring
  -- the application only can access the physical instance once the
  -- data is valid.
  input_region:wait_until_valid()

  -- To actually access data within a physical region, an application
  -- must create a RegionAccessor.  RegionAccessors provide a level
  -- of indirection between a physical instance and the application
  -- which is necessary for supporting general task code that is
  -- independent of data layout.  Note that each accessor must specify
  -- which field it is accessing and then pass the types to cast the
  -- field that is being accessed.

  local acc_y = input_region:get_field_accessor(FID_Y):typeify(double)

  -- We initialize our regions with some random data.  To iterate
  -- over all the points in each of the regions we use an iterator
  -- which can be used to enumerate all the points within an array.
  -- The points in the array (the 'p' field in the iterator) are
  -- used to access different locations in each of the physical
  -- instances.

  end

  -- Now we map our output region so we can do the actual computation.
  -- We use another inline launcher with a different RegionRequirement
  -- that specifies our privilege to be WRITE-DISCARD.  WRITE-DISCARD
  -- says that we can discard any data presently residing the region
  -- because we are going to overwrite it.
  local output_launcher =
    InlineLauncher:new(
      RegionRequirement:new(output_lr, legion.WRITE_DISCARD,
                            legion.EXCLUSIVE, output_lr))

  print("Done!")

  -- In some cases it may be necessary to unmap regions and then
  -- remap them.  We'll give a compelling example of this in the
  -- next example.   In this case we'll remap the output region
  -- with READ-ONLY privileges to check the output result.
  -- We really could have done this directly since WRITE-DISCARD
  -- privileges are equivalent to READ-WRITE privileges in terms
  -- of allowing reads and writes, but we'll explicitly unmap
  -- and then reamp.  Unmapping is done with the unamp call.
  -- After this call the physical region no longer contains valid
  -- data and all accessors from the physical region are invalidated.
  runtime:unmap_region(ctx, output_region)

  -- We can then remap the region.  Note if we wanted to remap
  -- with the same privileges we could have used the 'remap_region'
  -- call.  However, we want different privileges so we update
  -- the launcher and then remap the region.  The 'remap_region'
  -- call also guarantees that we would get the same physical
  -- instance.  By calling 'map_region' again, we have no such
  -- guarantee.  We may get the same physical instance or a new
  -- one.  The orthogonality of correctness from mapping decisions
  -- ensures that we will access the same data regardless.
