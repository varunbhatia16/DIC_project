  -- runtime can potentially run must be registered with the runtime.
  -- The function pointer is passed as a template argument.  The second
  -- argument specifies the kind of processor on which the task can be
  -- run: latency optimized cores (LOC) aka CPUs or throughput optimized
  -- cores (TOC) aka GPUs.  The last two arguments specify whether the
  -- task can be run as a single task or an index space task (covered
  -- in more detail in later examples).  The top-level task must always
  -- be able to be run as a single task.

-- interpreter is executed from the command line, only in which case
-- the arg global variable is set to a list of command line arguments.
