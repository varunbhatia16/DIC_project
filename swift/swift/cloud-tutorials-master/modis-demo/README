Setup
-----
To install modis, use SVN to check out the required scripts:

 TODO : Fix following.
$ svn co https://svn.ci.uchicago.edu/svn/vdl2/SwiftApps/modis

Once you do this, you also need the associated modis data.
To download the image data, run:

[source,bash]
-----
cd modis/data/modis/2002
wget http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/modis/modis-2002.tar.gz
tar -zxf modis-2002.tar.gz

Hello world
-----------
The script tutorial/hello.swift demonstrates a simple "hello world" 
script. It demonstrates how to define apps, passing arguments to 
an app, and how to work with files. In this example, a file called
hello.txt gets created with the contents of "Hello, world!".

To run the application, the command is:

$ swiftrun -site local tutorial/hello.swift

modis01.swift
-------------
The first modis example defines one app function called getLandUse.
This app takes a satellite image (data/modis/2002/h00v09.pgm.gz) as 
input. getLandUse creates a text file called landuse/h00v08.landuse.byfreq
that counts the frequency of each land type defined in the input image.

To run modis01.swift:

$ swiftrun -site local tutorial/modis01.swift

modis02.swift
-------------
The second modis example expands upon the first example by running getLandUse
with multiple (317) input files. Ouptut files are stored in the landuse directory.

To run modis02.swift:

$ swiftrun -site local tutorial/modis02.swift 

modis03.swift
-------------
The third modis example builds on the previous example. It defines a new app function
called analyzeLandUse. The analyzeLandUse app examines the data generated by getLandUse
and creates two summary files called topselected.txt and selectedtiles.txt. These
files contain information about the top 10 urban areas.

In the previous example, you have noticed that running all 317 input files on 
your laptop, even with 4 tasks a time, is not very efficient. In the next example,
instead of running locally, we will use a cluster called midway at the University of
Chicago to improve performance.

To run modis03.swift:

$ swiftrun -site midway tutorial/modis03.swift

modis04.swift
-------------
The fourth modis example adds another app called markMap that looks at selectedtiles.txt
and highlights the selected areas on a map. It will create a new image called 
markedGrid.ppm.

To run modis04.swift:

$ swiftrun -site midway tutorial/modis04.swift
